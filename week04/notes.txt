# WEEK 04

The Five Stages of Hacking
01 - Reconnaisance (Passive vs Active)
02 - Scanning and Enumeration (NMAP, Nessus, Nikto, etc...)
03 - Gaining Access
04 - Maintaining Access
05 - Covering Tracks

********************************************************************

01 - Passive Recon - Physical / Social
	Location Information:
		- Satellie images
		- Drone recon
		- Building Layout (badge readers, break areas, security, fencing)
	Job Information:
		- Employees (name, job title, phone number, manager, tec...)
		- Pictures (badge photos, desk photos, computer photos, etc...)
	Target Validate:
		- WHOIS, nslookup, dnsrecon
	Finding Subdomains:
		- GoogleFu, dig, nmap, Sublist3r, Bluto, crt.sh, etc...
	Fingerprinting:
		- nmap, Wappalyzer, WhatWeb, BuiltWith, NetCat
	Data Breaches:
		- HaveIBeenPwned and similar lists


	Hunter.io - For searching email addresses, and email naming conventions.

	Deep Learning model to analyze a large corpus of clear text passwords. - 1.4 Billion Text Credentials Analysis (NLP)
		- https://github.com/philipperemy/tensorflow-1.4-billion-password-analysis

	See - /week04/passwordParser.sh script
	
	Go to the company website.
		- Look up contact information page
	Look through Google maps.
		- Satellite view and street view
			- Look for guard stations, fencing, etc...

	Google address + "Satellite"
		- this will show a lot of possible satellite view sites.

	Google employee Names + <company name>
		- look for photos, and other relevant information.
		- Review Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc...

	Google site information
		- site:<company TLD> -www
			- shows everything without the "www" sites.
		- site:<company TLD> filetype:pdf
			- Shows PDFs on the site.

	Run The Harvester tool.
		- theHarvester -d w3bguy.com -l 200 -b google
			- Harvest up to 200 records, from Google, for w3bguy.com

	haveIbeenpwned.com
		- search known emails

	run bluto tool
		- bluto --domain=w3bguy.com -e --timeout=100 --api=2b0ab19df982a783877a6b59b982fdba4b6c3669

	run https://crt.sh
		- https://crt.sh/?q=%25.w3bguy.com
			- returns a lot of certificate information about w3bguy.com

************************************
Fingerprinting
	- Wappalyzer browser plugin
	- whatweb terminal app
		- whatweb -v w3bguy.com
	- builtwith.com website
